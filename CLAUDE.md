# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Michael Lee (myklee.com). The original static HTML site has been archived and this repository is ready for a new site implementation.

## Repository Structure

```
├── archive/
│   └── v1/             # Archived original site (HTML/LESS/JS)
├── assets/             # Reusable assets for new site
│   ├── images/         # Social media icons and UI elements
│   ├── res/            # Design files and high-res portfolio images
│   └── README.md       # Asset documentation
└── CLAUDE.md          # This file
```

## Available Assets

### Images
- Social media icons (LinkedIn, Dribbble, Tumblr) - 32px PNG format
- Portfolio photography in various resolutions

### Design Files
- Adobe Photoshop files (`.psd`) with original artwork
- Adobe Illustrator files (`.ai`) for vector graphics
- High-resolution portfolio images suitable for modern web formats

## Archived Site (v1)

The original site (archived in `archive/v1/`) was:
- Static HTML with LESS stylesheets
- Flickity.js carousel functionality
- Client-side LESS compilation
- Responsive design with Google Fonts integration

Reference the archived files for content structure, design patterns, and asset usage when building the new site.

## Development Notes

- Assets in `/assets/` directory are ready for use in new site
- Consider modern web technologies for the new implementation
- Original content structure can be referenced from `archive/v1/index.html`
- Design assets can be optimized for modern formats (WebP, AVIF, etc.)
